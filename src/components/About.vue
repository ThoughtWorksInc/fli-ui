    What is it?
  </h3>
  <p>
    "Fli" (working title) is envisioned as a tool for managing and tracking the complexities of delivering software in an agile team.  It's not meant to replace an ALM tool, but rather to supplement it with quick and simple interactions and detailed auditing and measures to monitor the effectiveness of practices and improvements.
